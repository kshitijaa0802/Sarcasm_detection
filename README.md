# Multimodal Sarcasm Detection Using Attention Mechanism

This project aims to detect sarcasm in conversations using multimodal data: **text (BERT)**, **audio (MFCC)**, and **visual (ResNet)** features, combined using **attention mechanisms**.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Transformers (BERT)
- ResNet
- Librosa (for MFCC extraction)

## 📁 Dataset
- [MUStARD Dataset](https://github.com/dair-iitd/MUStARD)

## 🧪 Project Overview
- Extracted BERT embeddings from utterances
- Extracted ResNet features from video frames
- Extracted MFCC features from audio
- Used an attention mechanism to fuse all 3 modalities
- Final model achieved **83% precision**
